What is it about Mao's thinking that resonanted with the Chinese:
-Resonated with China's issues
-Unique/Unifying national identity
	Easier to embrace when others are believing in it
	Distinctive to China
-Imperialist elements in China
	Anti-imperialist rhetoric

-Recreation of political authority and power
	Mao's personality itself is a component of Maoism		

Early 1980s
Transition and reform stayed relatively Maoist

Spiritual pollution:
	Deng criticizes the return of bourgeois capitalist elements
	Not yet opposed to Deng Xiaoping, but is negative toward the change in culture
	Resemeblance of a second Cultural Revolution.
        	Diff: Social movement, not controlled by the party.
	Perspective from intellectuals/upper class
		-Extremely wary of a return to Maoist era

Anti-Bourgeois Liberalism Campaign



Economic improvements:
	-Economic zones
	-Increasing inequality
		Geography
		Wealth

-Idealistic: Deng Liqun
	-Willing to go by pragmatics, but is looking at both routes

Deng Liqun:
Likes the growth in economy (limited open economy)
	BUT
Does not like the increasing power of the market.
If the market gains too much control compared to the state, then equality is broken.
Loosened/Weakened state-control.
Growing private economy.
Incoming foreign ideas.

Legacy of Maoism:
	Influence fading.
	Lack of realistic prospects.
Unlikely to happen in modern society:
	Influence of money and the privatization of the economy.
	Trend is going away from Mao.
	-Mao fever:
		-Social costs of reforms.
		-Ressurgence of Mao.
		-Potential for ressurgence is always there.

Mao:
	Did not look into the deeper currents of human nature:
	People are tired of his revolutions
Deng Xiaoping: 
	Money for all convinces everyone to go along.
